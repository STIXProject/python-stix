python-stix |release| Documentation
===================================

The **python-stix** library provides an API for developing and consuming *Structured Threat Information eXpression* (**STIX**) content. Developers can leverage the API to develop applications that create, consume, translate, or otherwise process STIX content. This page should help new developers get started with using this library. For more information about STIX, please refer to the `STIX website`_.

.. note::

    These docs provide standard reference for this Python library. For documentation on *idiomatic* usage and *common patterns*, as well as various STIX-related information and utilities, please visit the `STIXProject at GitHub`_.

Users and developers working with multiple versions of STIX content may want
to take a look at `stix-ramrod`_, which is a library designed to update STIX
and CybOX content.

Check out the `Working with python-stix`_ section for examples on how to
integrate **stix-ramrod** and **python-stix**.

FAQ
===

- My RAM consumption rises when processing a large amount of files.
    This problem is caused by a python-cybox_ caching mechanism that is enabled
    by default. To prevent this issue from happening use the
    ``cybox.utils.caches.cache_clear()`` method in your code/script to release
    the cached resources as appropriate. Refer to the ``cybox`` documentation
    for more details.
